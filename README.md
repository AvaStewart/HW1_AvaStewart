Hello hopefully this is in the readMe document.

This is my submission for Homework1. 

A little bit about the design of the piece:
Before I started this homework I was scrolling through Open Processing to get some inspiration and to look at examples. I saw one that had little flower shapes in boxes dancing around and it inspired me to base the design for this homework off of quilt blocks. I really like quilts and I thought it would be a good idea because they are inherently geometric. Also they hold some history in relation to coding and computers because the first computer coders were women, often those who were avid "crafters," into things like needlepoint and quilting. These skills made them good programmers because both acts are tedious, require attention to detail, and patience. 

Kandinsky's scope is similar to that of quilting, emphasizing geometric elements like point, line, and plane, but looks vastly different in execution due to the method. One is free flowing paint and the other is solid fabric. I think it is interesting to combine these ideas and play against them on the screen. Coding can feel very rigid if you have limited knowledge or skill, and becomes more free-flowing and creative the more practice and knowledge you have. 

Working on the project:
I went into this with little to no coding knowledge, but feel a lot more confident in my skills now. At least I know that if I don't understand something, I can consult the Processing website and understand how to apply new concepts. One of the major things I learned from this project was the grid and how to place things next to each other or where you want them to go. When I first started coding, I had given up on the quilt block idea, but as I strengthened my skills I decided to come back to it. I also learned how to add the interactions, and more importantly how to trouble shoot them. My main method of troubleshooting was to comment out the code I knew worked partially, and edit a copy and pasted version on a new line.
